Notes from my brief experiment with a Windows 8 box:

* Has much better focus indicator for Windows

* Explorer Windows now has a ribbon; e.g.,
  [Windows 8 Explorer]view->hidden items

* WordPad also has a ribbon

* win key by self => start window
* win+f => start window, find files (can switch to apps or settings)

* ExpanDrive 2 does not support Windows 8; need version 3 for that

* with start window, can just start typing to search



DNS 12 on Windows 8:

* Vocola commands do work on start window

* "start window", "open Control Panel"

* no select and say of Windows 8 apps; ditto "click X"

* show number plus doesn't work on start window

* "scratch that" or built-in backspacing commands are very slow on start
  window; dictation speed is reasonable, however.
