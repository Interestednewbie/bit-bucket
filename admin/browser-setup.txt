Steps to follow to set up my browsers:



>>>>> Firefox:

 * Download Firefox 47+ and install
   ?* custom install: use maintenance service, no icon on desktop

  * menu widget (three horizontal lines on top right)->customize
     show/hide toolbars->menu bar

 * Set options (tools->options):

   general->homepage: https://www.google.com/
            always ask me where to save files
   search->default search engine: Google
   	   !provide search suggestions
   privacy->manage your do not track settings->use do not track
   advanced->data choices->!enable crash reporter

 * Download and install the following extensions:

   * mouseless browsing
     * see Firefox.vcl for configuration instructions
     * [work only for JIRA] set !general->show IDs before images...
   [optionally also]
   * VimFx 0.17.2
     * configure options per Firefox.vcl:
       hints chars: 012345678 9
       blacklist: *

   #* new tab homepage 0.5.2
   #* new tab homepage focus 0.4.3.1
      did not work (change focus to new tab)
   * my homepage
   * cookie exporter 1.5.1 [to export cookies for wget]
 [rest home only]
   * Ghostery 5.4.10
     * skip Wizard
     * turn on block all categories except widgets; auto update
     * [default] to turn off alert bubble,
         Tools> Ghostery> Manage Ghostery Options in Firefox, then click
           on the Advanced Tab and uncheck the box for "Show Alert
	   Bubble", you won't get the annoying display when visiting pages.
   * NoScript 2.6.5.8

   * AdBlock plus 2.2.3 add-in
     * [default] easy list subscription, some nonintrusive advertising

 * view->toolbars->bookmarks toolbar

 * Go to the following URL to opt out of tracking [repeat when lose cookies]:

     http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp

   May take repeated tries over time to get all of them.

 * Install HPE root certificate:

  [was: Go to the following URL to install the HP root certificate:

     https://hpedia.osp.hpe.com/wiki/Get_a_digital_badge
       ->
       https://digitalbadge.corp.hp.com/hp/CAs/HPE_PrivateRootCA.base64.zip
       ...
  ]

    Current HPE root certificates saved to: 
      work:~/.ssh/HPE_PrivateRootCA.cer
      work:~/.ssh/HP_Ent_Private_SSL_CA.cer
  
    Firefox: tools->options->advanced->certificates->view certificates
             ->authorities->import
             trust for all purposes (three checkmarks)

 * [home] use Firefox persona "clean brushed steel" by vanityFlair
   http://www.getpersonas.com/en-US/persona/219524
   [needs noscript permission]

 * [work] Install my digital badge class B:
    * tools->options->advanced->certificates->view certificates
      ->your certificates->import
      from: work:~/.ssh/digital badge class B expires 2017.pfx

 ?* install latest version of flash, 11.6, *but*
    * seems to work much better to let FF add it when need media
      * adobe download site wouldn't show download button on firefox
    * notify me when updates are available
    * this will break SendKeys, SetMousePosition and the like
    * add the following line:
ProtectedMode=0
      to the following files:
        c:/Windows/SysWOW64/Macromed/Flash/mms.cfg
    * [home] be EXTREMELY careful to change adminstrator version not normal one
      (Vista UAC issue)
      * open an administrator command prompt then:
cd C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Macromed\Flash
copy mms.cfg + con
ProtectedMode=0
^Z
type mms.cfg
    * verify file has ProtectedMode line from a non-administrator command prompt
    * then exit browser and restart DNS; SendKeys should be working again
  * [home] Go to
       http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html 
       and set flash privacy policy
         * global storage settings: 0 KB, no 3rd party storage, never ask again

  * [experiment at work]
    installed the "print pages to PDF" 0.1.9.3 plug-in

  * [experiment at home]
    https://www.eff.org/HTTPS-EVERYWHERE

  * [experiment at home]  Try just url below; looks good on newer FF
    Open a new tab, enter "about:config" into the location bar and hit
    the "Enter" key. If you get a warning page, click "I'll be careful,
    I promise!" This will bring you to the Firefox configuration
    settings. In the search bar up top, type ".dhe_" and hit the "Enter"
    key. This should result in two settings being displayed:
    "security.ssl3.dhe_rsa_aes_128_sha" and
    "security.ssl3.dhe_rsa_aes_256_sha". Double-click both of them to
    change the value from "true" to "false".
    https://www.howsmyssl.com/ allows checking those cipthers are gone

       http://intranet.hp.com/HPIT/GetIT/DigitalBadge/Pages/page.aspx?q=InstallCACertificate_IE
    ]

    Current HPE root certificates saved to:

      work:~/.ssh/HP_Ent_Private_SSL_CA.cer
  
    IE: Internet options->content->certificates->trusted root certificates
        ->import     


  * Ideally, restore old bookmarks by:
    * delete initial bookmarks: "destroy all favorites"
    * "import bookmarks"
      * reorder bookmark folders to match bookmark_folders.vch
      * may need to restart Internet Explorer to have favorites bar show up
        * may need to actually drag bookmarks into Favorites Bar
          subdirectory via Windows Explorer for the directory gotten by
          "destroy all favorites"
      * actually looks like it suffices to go to 1st favorite and use
        favorites->add to favorite bar  <<<>>>

  * [work, not using FMA] Install my digital badge class B:
    * tools->Internet options->content->certificates->import

AdBlock plus
Disconnect

? noscript
? Exporting cookies for wget
? new tab homepage
? ghostery for chrome?
Freesr interferes with chrome tabs

  * must manually put a bookmark in Upload for bookmark that to work

  * I believe chrome shares proxy and certificates with IE




>>>>> Microsoft Edge:

<<<>>>

imported favorites from Internet Explorer, turned on the favorites bar

  * menu icon (... in upper right)->settings

===============

default Windows proxy (PC COE) is: http://autocache.hp.com/

use system proxy settings

setenv HTTP_PROXY web-proxy.labs.hpecorp.net:8080
setenv FTP_PROXY  web-proxy.labs.hpecorp.net:8080

at home, I am having Firefox remember most low security passwords
