Steps to follow to set up my browsers:



>>>>> Chrome:

  * Download Chrome 54+ and install

  * menu icon (three dots on top right)->settings:
    * on startup->open a specific page
      https://www.google.com
    * appearance->
        show home button (new tab: https://www.google.com)
        always show the bookmarks bar
    * search: Google
    * default browser->make Google Chrome the default browser
    * advanced->
      * privacy
        !use a prediction service to help complete searches
        send do not track
      * downloads: ask where to save each file

  * Download and install the following extensions:
    * Click by Voice
      allow in incognito, allow access to file URLs
  [work only]
    * new tab URL
      options: https://www.google.com
  [rest home only]
    [set developer mode in extensions]
    * Mark's experimental extension
      from PC ~/document/experimental_extension

       ? ghostery for chrome?
    Google Docs
    Google Docs off-line
    Google sheets
    Google slides

  * do *not* enable Dragon web extension

  * Ideally, use "pull bookmarks" to restore bookmarks to last backup
     * may need to clean out links in update folder
     * otherwise, must manually put a bookmark in Upload for "bookmark
       that" to work

  * [home] Go to
       http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html 
       and set flash privacy policy
         * global storage settings: 0 KB, no 3rd party storage, never ask again

  * Chrome gets its proxy information from Windows
    certificates as well I believe

  * I elsewhere disable Freesr's top indicator widget because it
    interferes with (covers up) Chrome's tabs



>>>>> Firefox:

  * Download Firefox 47+ and install
   ?* custom install: use maintenance service, no icon on desktop

  * menu widget (three horizontal lines on top right)->customize
    show/hide toolbars->menu bar

  * view->toolbars->bookmarks toolbar

  * Set options (tools->options):

    general->homepage: https://www.google.com/
             always ask me where to save files
    search->default search engine: Google
    	   !provide search suggestions
    privacy->manage your do not track settings->use do not track
    advanced->data choices->!enable crash reporter

  * Download and install the following extensions:

    * mouseless browsing
      * see Firefox.vcl for configuration instructions
    * my homepage
      these extensions do not work: new tab homepage, new tab homepage focus
    * cookie exporter 1.5.1 [to export cookies for wget]
  [rest home only]
    * HTTPS everywhere
    * NoScript 2.6.5.8
      * [default] options->notifications->place message at the bottom
    * AdBlock plus 2.2.3 add-in
      * [default] easy list subscription, some nonintrusive advertising
    * Ghostery 5.4.10
      * skip Wizard
      * turn on block all categories except widgets; auto update
      * [default] to turn off alert bubble,
          Tools> Ghostery> Manage Ghostery Options in Firefox, then click
            on the Advanced Tab and uncheck the box for "Show Alert
 	   Bubble", you won't get the annoying display when visiting pages.
    ?* [plug-in] Adobe shockwave player 12.0.0.112

  * Ideally, use "pull bookmarks" to restore bookmarks to last backup
    * may need to clean out links in update folder

  * Go to the following URL to opt out of tracking [repeat when lose cookies]:

      http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp

    May take repeated tries over time to get all of them.

  * [home] use Firefox persona "clean brushed steel" by vanityFlair
    http://www.getpersonas.com/en-US/persona/219524
    [needs noscript permission]

  * install latest version of flash when need media (wait for prompt)
    * adobe download site wouldn't show download button on firefox
    * notify me when updates are available
    * [home] Go to
       http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html 
       and set flash privacy policy
         * global storage settings: 0 KB, no 3rd party storage, never ask again



>>>>> Internet Explorer:

  * If asked, turn off Phishing filter.

  * Right-click on tabs line empty part & Enable menu toolbar
    disable McAfee and/or Bing toolbars if present

  * Set homepage to https://encrypted.google.com/

  * Configure options:

    * Internet Explorer->tools->options:
      ->general->tabs: open homepage for new tabs
      ?->programs->manage add-ons: disable Microsoft live search toolbar,
        norton toolbar

  * Go to the following URL to opt out of tracking [repeat when lose cookies]:

    http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp

  * Ideally, restore old bookmarks by:
    * delete initial bookmarks: "destroy all favorites"
    * "import bookmarks"
      * reorder bookmark folders to match bookmark_folders.vch
      * may need to restart Internet Explorer to have favorites bar show up
        * may need to actually drag bookmarks into Favorites Bar
          subdirectory via Windows Explorer for the directory gotten by
          "destroy all favorites"
      * actually looks like it suffices to go to 1st favorite and use
        favorites->add to favorite bar  <<<>>>



>>>>> Microsoft Edge:

<<<>>>

imported favorites from Internet Explorer, turned on the favorites bar

  * menu icon (... in upper right)->settings
    ->view advanced settings [need to scroll down]
      show the home button
      send do not track requests
