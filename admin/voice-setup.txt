Steps to set up my voice infrastructure:


0. If you previously had DNS already installed (any version):
   * exit DNS, FreeSR
   * uninstall NatLink from control panel
     * optional: completely remove C:\NatLink
       * see Windows permissions.txt in this directory
       * will require reboot
   * uninstall wxPython, Pythonwin, Python from control panel
   * uninstall DNS from the control panel
   * run appropriate DNS remover utility
     [see ~/voice/DNS removal]


1. Install DNS  [may require previous version's disk (not for my DPI 14)]

1.5. Create a new profile
   * set options:
     * do not send usage data
     * overall options:
       corrections:
	 !select commands bring up correction menu
         select commands search backwards
	 correct commands bring up spelling window
	 !auto add commands to vocabulary
	 !show smart format rules
       commands:
         turn off web search, desktop search, e-mail and calendar,
	   delete, copy commands
	 more commands->disable: Facebook, twitter, WordPerfect commands
       view:
         anchor to bottom
	 results box anchor, 10 seconds before going away
	 show preliminary results
       misc:
         mike asleep on open
	 !auto save profile changes
	 auto sleep only after maximum time
	 !dictation box for unsupported applications
       data:

     * formatting options:
       insert two spaces after period
   * scan against e-mail but not documents

?     audio->read text...

2. Install NatLink/Vocola:
   * install Python, Pythonwin, wxPython; currently using 2.7
   * install combined installer
   * create ~/NatLink, ~/NatLink/Vocola on PC
   * enable NatLink & Vocola

3. Load commands:
   * ~/voice/my_commands/extensions/* -> C:\NatLink\NatLink\Vocola\extensions\
     * then "load extensions"

     * "load all commands"
   * ~/voice/my_commands/AutoHotkey/* -> PC: ~/NatLink/AutoHotkey  [create]
     "import commands" should work if created
   * from ~/voice/my_commands/NatLink, copy to "MacroSystem":
     _alias.py
     _logging.py
   * no Advanced Scripting commands being used at this time
   * update/create environment-<machine>.vch macros if needed

4. Local Vocola improvements:
    * prepare personal version of Vocola:
      [foil]
        cd ~/voice/Vocola_development/Vocola_2
        git checkout Mark
        make clean; make
    * install it:
      "import Vocola"
      "install Vocola"
    * restart DNS

5. Load vocabulary:
   * if scanned email:
     use "edit words", custom words only, to prune bad words from
     e-mail
   * import my vocabulary:
     * "load normal vocabulary"
     * disable RSIGuard, Freesr
     * "edit words", "load compiled words"
     * enable RSIGuard
   * train via corpus:
     * make corpus in my commands  [prefer work corpus if available]
     * copy to my documents/corpus
     * help->improve my accuracy->learn from specific documents
       * use folder corpus only
       * uncheck all (add no words)
       [2/2/2015 work: had to remove top_foil.txt because it was crashing dragon]
     * remove corpus files from PC
   * save user profile"


6. load VBA macros into:
   * Word 2013
    * add developer tab to the ribbon:
      * file->options->customize ribbon:

	  box on the right top;
        check the developer box below it on the right
