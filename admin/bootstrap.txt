Instructions for using bootstrap as of November 2016:

[consider early install of SmartNav for home install in future]



In preparation:

 [on foil]
  * get current custom version of Vocola 2
      cd ~/voice/Vocola_development/Vocola_2
      git checkout Mark
      make clean; make

 [rest done on preparation computer; foil or (pseudo-)work master server as
  appropriate]

  * update ~/backups/Vocola-patches.bat if needed; it may need expected
    home directory location.

  * download software as needed into C:\PC_setup according to 
    ~/backups/downloads_needed.html

  * adjust ~/voice/my_commands/commands/environment-bootstrap.vch as
    needed to reflect information known about new environment.  Should
    be parallel to environment.vch.

  * adjust/create SSH keys pairs for future PC if needed
    * need id_rsa[_putty.ppk] in ~/.ssh of preparation computer

  * Prepare bootstrap:
      cd ~/backups
      make Vocola-prepare
      make DPI14
      make bootstrap-prepare
      * make sure bootstrap-prepare doesn't complain about missing DPI
        14 setup.exe or Vocola
      make bootstrap-print
      make bootstrap
 
  * mount my 64 GB USB stick, open its encrypted volume [creation
    instructions in home-2013.txt]
    * copy ~/backups/bootstrap onto USB stick
    * remove USB stick afterwards

  * cleanup:
      cd ~/backups
      make clean-all


On target computer:

  * insert USB stick
    * install VeraCrypt from USB stick
      * no icon
    * open encrypted volume then
    * copy bootstrap/* to PC ~/
      * make sure get .emacs and.ssh by first doing:
        * [Explorer]tools->folder options->view->show hidden files
        * [Windows 8 Explorer]view->hidden items
    * Dismount then exit VeraCrypt; eject afterwards


Basic voice control:

  * install DPI 14 from PC ~/setup/DPI14/Dragon.exe
    * fallback: ~/setup/DPI 14 setup.exe
    * had to kill agent.exe (FlexConnect agent) when asked
      * Dragon offers to do it, but will fail so kill first
    * takes a *long* time; 30+ minutes?
    * should ask you to download and apply hot fix 2 or 3
      * have saved copies of hot fixes 2-3 in ~/setup

  * start DNS, create a profile
    * set options per step 1 of voice-setup.txt
    * do not scan documents or email
    * export profile to PC ~/Dragon user backups

  * install Python, Pythonwin, wxPython from PC ~/setup
     use Python 2.7; Python 2.6 is officially retired
  * ditto for NatLink combined installer

  * run PC ~/setup/Vocola-patches.bat

  * enable NatLink and Vocola via NatLink GUI configuration tool

  * restart DNS

  * install AutoHotkey from PC ~/setup
      * express install (64-bit Unicode, in C:\Program Files (x86)\AutoHotkey


==========
Advanced voice (loading vocabulary; basically step 5 of voice-set up.txt):

?  * train
?    audio->read text...

  * "load setup vocabulary"

  * "edit words", "load compiled words"
    [RSIGuard is not off (not installed yet) at this point]

  * train via PC ~/corpus, remove it
     * help->improve my accuracy->learn from specific documents
       * use folder corpus only
       * uncheck all (add no words)

  * "save user profile", backup profile to PC ~/Dragon user backups

  * installing VBA macros (step 6 of voice_setup.txt) is not included in
    the bootstrap functionality

  * before doing "import commands" later, on master server do:
    * Create appropriate environment-XXX.vch file


Install local Emacs:

  * install local PC Emacs:
    * copy PC:~\setup\Emacs to C:\Program Files (x86)\
      (not the shortcut labeled emacs)
    * execute addpm.exe from ~pf32/Emacs/bin
    * execute install_emacs.bat from PC:~/setup *as administrator*
      [above relies on HOME environment variable being set by Vocola_patches.bat]


Connection software:

  * run PC ~/setup/Cygwin-64bit-setup.exe   
    [this takes long enough that you may want to do other steps in parallel]
    * defaults except:
      * use Internet Explorer proxy settings
      * local package directory: ~/setup/Cygwin64   [already exists; browse]
      * X11, editors, shells, net: install

  * "open Cygwin [terminal]"
    * Set up home directory location based on whoami; move old /home
      directory aside if needed:
        cd /home; ln -s /cygdrive/c/Users/LillibridgeM/Documents LillibridgeM
         -or-
        cd /home; ln -s /cygdrive/c/Users/Mark/Documents Mark
    * chmod og= ~/.ssh ~/.ssh/*
    * add to /etc/fstab by using PC emacs to edit c:/cygwin64/etc/fstab
      comment out the last line:
none /cygdrive cygdrive binary,posix=0,user 0 0
      and append the following line:
none /cygdrive cygdrive binary,posix=0,user,noacl 0 0

  * install putty from PC ~/setup
    * want desktop icon
    * start putty, change settings:
        keyboard: backspace sends ^H
        window: 80x30
        appearance: font: Consolas, 10 point
                    clearType
          (was courier 10 point, default)
        SSH->X11: enable X11 forwarding
      save session settings as password
        SSH->Auth->browse: PC: ~/.ssh/id_rsa_putty
      save session settings as no-password
    * edit shortcut on desktop to
      [home] putty foil with shortcut:
        "C:\Program Files (x86)\PuTTY\putty.exe" -load no-password -l mdl 192.168.1.2
?      [work] putty ts-rhel6 with shortcut:
?        "C:\Program Files (x86)\PuTTY\putty.exe" -load no-password -l mdl ts-rhel6.labs.hpecorp.net


Connecting to foil:

  * "local/remote foil putty"; "launch X" or "invoke login"; "invoke startup"
    * may need to unblock xwin first time run


Connecting to Work:

?  * [home] Install VPN software from PC ~/setup
? Voice command to connect


Local utilities:

  * install Chrome
    * installer in PC ~/setup; see instructions in browsers-setup.txt
    * don't import from Internet Explorer

  * install Firefox
    * installer in PC ~/setup; see instructions in browsers-setup.txt
    * don't import from Internet Explorer

  * install Freesr
    * from PC:~/setup
      [new version may be free] <<<>>>
    * "load setup Free SR"
      fallback: copy PC:~/setup/voice/Mark.lang to 
                     PC:~\Freesr\Voice Commands\Languages\User Defined
    * settings->speech->enable microphone on startup
                      ->set voice command language
                          to Mark.Lang
              ->program->run this program when the PC starts up
                         *Don't* show side voice window
			 on startup->!Show top indicator widget
    * Putting all windows on main taskbar so FreeSR can see them
      * right-click on taskbar empty part->settings:
          combine taskbar buttons: never
        multiple displays:
          show taskbar buttons on: main taskbar and taskbar where window is open
	  combine buttons on other taskbars: never
        Notification area:
	  ->select which icons appear on the taskbar
	    always show all icons
	    [was off, show FreeSR, NVDIA, SFTP, DNS, Task Mgr, AV, network, volume]
    * unlock taskbar (from RC?), increase taskbar size to two rows, then
      relock the taskbar
