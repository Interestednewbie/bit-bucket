;  Under Xemacs, setnu mode may work better:
;
;(load "~/elisp/setnu")
;(load "~/elisp/setnu+")    ; recent bug fixes...
;
; unlike wb-line-number mode, setnu mode must be turned on a buffer by buffer 
; basis; here we turn it on by default just for Java buffers:
;(add-hook 'java-mode-hook 'turn-on-setnu-mode)
