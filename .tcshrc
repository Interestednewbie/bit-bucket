# This is my .tcshrc file; it first sources .cshrc then does some tcsh

source ~/.cshrc


# bind delete key to delete next character for compatibility with Windows:
#  (this messes up Cygwin's backspacing; I remove the bindkey line in the 
#   Makefile for bootstrap)
bindkey "" delete-char

# need to find shift-left separately on some versions of tcsh:
#  (switched to rebinding shift-left and shift-right in xterm)
# bindkey "^[[1;2D" backward-char


  # get emacs-style word movement:
set wordchars='$%'


  # bindings for leaping (see .Xdefaults):
  # note: {, ^ don't work due to tcsh bug with globbing
bindkey ^Xs i-search-fwd
bindkey ^Xr i-search-back
bindkey ^r  tty-flush-output   # use this to exit search


  # in theory, in future versions of tcsh, this will highlight the
  # region between the point and mark:
set highlight=on
