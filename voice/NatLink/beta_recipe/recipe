    By request, here's my attempt to pull together the latest recipe for
working around the issues with DNS 12 for Vocola 2 into a single email.
This hasn't been tested yet so tester beware.  Explanations in []'s.

* install DNS 12  [Duh]

* Install NatLink and Vocola 2 with Python 2.6; instructions at:
    http://vocola.net/v2/InstallVocola.asp
  * you must use Python 2.6 for now  [only have new Natlink.pyd for 2.6]
  * be sure to install NatLink to the default location, C:\NatLink
  * after step 4 of the above, *disable* NatLink using the same
    configuration program
    [we enable then disable things to get things set up properly]

* edit C:\NatLink\NatLink\macrosystem\core\natlinkmain.py and change
  line 99 from:
cmdLineStartup=0
  to:
cmdLineStartup=1
  [make output go to standard out rather than a nonexistent macro messages window]

* replace C:\NatLink\NatLink\macrosystem\core\NatLink26.pyd with the
  attached version
  [this version uses a generic engine sink interface rather than the no
  longer available NatLink one]

* copy it also to NatLink.pyd in the same destination directory
  (replacing old version)

* copy attached start_8.py also to the same destination directory

* copy attached vcl2py.py to C:\NatLink\NatLink\Vocola\exec\
  [A new experimental Vocola compiler that does not rely on gotBegin
  calls to determine when an utterance starts.]

* edit C:\NatLink\NatLink\macrosystem\_vocola_main.py,
  locate the runVocolaTranslator routine definition; should be somewhere
  around line 350.  Then add the following line:
        call = 'c:\Python26\Python.exe "' + self.VocolaFolder + r'\exec\vcl2py.py" '  
  before the following line:
        call += '-extensions "' + ExtensionsFolder + r'\extensions.csv" '
  [switch to the new Vocola compiler]


* start DNS 12; NatLink will not start yet

* start a MS-DOS command prompt window (start menu->cmd.exe?)
  type "C:\python26\python" then enter to start an instance of Python
  type "import start_8" then enter

* with luck, you'll see something like the following in your command
  prompt window:
c:\>C:\python26\python
Python 2.6.4 (r264:75708, Oct 26 2009, 08:23:19) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] on
win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import start_8
Vocola version 2.7.3I starting...
Starting natlinkmain from C:\NatLink\NatLink\MacroSystem\core:
  NatLink version: 4.0
  DNS version: 12
  Python version: 2.6
  Windows Version: Vista

natlinkmain started (imported)

  In addition, a window labeled "NatLink heartbeat control" should have
  popped up in the center of one of your monitors.

* At this point, NatLink is running and your global non-title specific
  Vocola commands should be working.  Any output will go to the command
  prompt window instead of a macro messages from Python window.
  However, commands for applications and title-specific commands are
  probably not working correctly.  Click the start button on the NatLink
  heartbeat control window and you should start getting heartbeat
  messages from the command prompt window.  At this point, all of your
  Vocola commands should be working.  [The heartbeat watches for changes
  of title and window, and makes sure the correct commands are active
  for the new title/window.]

  The heartbeat messages are pretty verbose at the moment for debugging;
  feel free to comment out the relevant print statements in start_8.py

* When you are done, click the stop button in the NatLink heartbeat
  control then the close window button for that window.  That should
  make the NatLink heartbeat control window disappear and your Python
  instance in the command prompt window exit.

* If done with DNS, shut it down now.  Else, you should be able to
  restart NatLink by invoking Python and start_8.py again.


    Assuming this recipe works well and doesn't reveal new problems, it
can probably be cleaned up somewhat -- fewer hand motions, less verbose,
something closer to the macro messages window, etc.

PS, thanks again to reckoner for building the needed NatLink.pyd.
