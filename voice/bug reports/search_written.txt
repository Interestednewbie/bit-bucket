Bug #160215-001464

Vocabulary Editor search works incorrectly with non-alphabetical written forms


Example: add the following vocabulary words:

  .o\dot O
  .\dot op

Now, search for "dot O" in the Vocabulary Editor "search for:" field.
You will see the following results below:

  .o\dot O
  .\dot op
  .org\dot ORG
  .org\dot org

Now hit tab; at this point you're supposed to be able to type a prefix
of the written form to further narrow down your search.  However, typing
"."  incorrectly moves you to:

  .\dot op

Maybe this is ok, but now (quickly) type "o" and notice it now has
incorrectly selected:

  .org\dot ORG

This is clearly not okay since ".o" is in fact in the results list.
