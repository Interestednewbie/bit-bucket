dictating (into) a chart title doesn't work in Excel 2013 (not office 365)


Open Excel 2007 and create a chart with a title in the usual way.

Select a known cell near the chart and visible. Now select the chart title by clicking on it once (this should produce a solid or dashed line around the chart title). Dictate "Bob" then press the right arrow. You will see that "Bob" appears in the cell you selected, not the chart title.

The same happens if you highlight a piece of the chart title and then dictate. The same problem appears to happen with other chart parts. 

This is been broken since at least DNS 11 and Excel 2007.
