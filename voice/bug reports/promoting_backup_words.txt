import words fails to promote backup words using XML format


Oertli is a backup word, at least for medium vocabulary US, DPI 14.   If
I import from:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?>

<!DOCTYPE WordExport SYSTEM "http://dragoncontent.nuance.com/dtds/Words10.dtd">

<WordExport NatspeakVersion="14.00.000.180" NatspeakEdition="ProfessionalIndividual" User="new" Topic="General - Medium" Language="ENX" MRECVersion="1.28.100.16375">

	<Word name="Oertli">
	</Word>

</WordExport>

it does not get added to my dictionary, whether I choose to overwrite it
or not.

However, if I use the TXT format:

@Version=Plato-UTF8
Oertli

it does not ask me about overwriting and successfully promotes that word
from the backup dictionary to be in my active dictionary.
