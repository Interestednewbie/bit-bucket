import XML list of words fails for words spoken and written forms separately already exist in the vocabulary?


I'm not sure exactly what triggers this, but I can give you two
examples.  Add the following words to the vocabulary:

  Poe Ray
  POE RAY

Now import (vocabulary->import list of words or phrasesâ€¦) the following file:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?>

<!DOCTYPE WordExport SYSTEM "http://dragoncontent.nuance.com/dtds/Words10.dtd">

<WordExport NatspeakVersion="14.00.000.180" NatspeakEdition="ProfessionalIndividual" User="Mark virgin" Topic="General - Medium" Language="ENX" MRECVersion="1.28.100.16375">

	<Word name="POE RAY\\Poe Ray">
	</Word>
	<Word name="POE\\Poe">
	</Word>

</WordExport>

Note that Dragon erroneously claims that there are no new words found,
when it should find two new words.

I think the problem may be that the vocabulary importer checks to see if
the spoken and written forms already exist, but does not ensure they
exist in the *same* word.

Note that in my default US medium vocabulary the following vocabulary
words already exist:

  Poe
  POE

Dragon also refuses to correctly add du\DU.
