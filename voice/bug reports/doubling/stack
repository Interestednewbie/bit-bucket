I and others use Dragon NaturallySpeaking to program by voice; it uses
the wh_JournalPlayback hook to send synthetic keystrokes to programs
like Emacs when you dictate words or execute voice commands.  This
method of sending synthetic keystrokes is roughly equivalent to the old
version of SendKeys or AutoHotkey's Send Play mode.  Unfortunately, with
Vista and particularly with Windows 7, initial synthetic keystrokes sent
this way are often dropped or doubled.  For example, dictating "Fred"
may result in "fred" (dropped the initial shift key) and dictating
"hello" may result in "hhello" (doubled the initial "h").  More rarely,
later keystrokes may be affected as well.  This bug seems bursty, at
times occurring practically every time and the rest of the time
occurring seldom.

I have been trying to track down, produce a reliable recipe for
demonstrating it, or fix this bug for over a year; web searches don't
turn up anything other than the occasional other person having trouble
with SendKeys.  The web's advice tends to be to stop doing that (using
this method of synthetic key generation).  Unfortunately, Dragon
NaturallySpeaking is closed source and I have no ability to patch it to
use a different method.  :-(

Can anyone help me?  It smells like a Microsoft operating system race
condition bug.  The fact it is bursty seems to imply that some other
intermittent process makes it far worst at times.


Test code for AutoHotkey (dropping.ahk, requires UAC off):

    #SingleInstance Force
    
    f11::
     SendMode Play
     Send AutoHotkey SendMode Play:{enter}
     Loop, 5 {
      Loop, 10 {
        Send .{space}
        Send {,}{space}
      }
      Send {!}{enter}
     }
     Send {space}{enter}
     return
    
    f12::
     SendMode Play
     Send AutoHotkey SendMode Play:{enter}
     Loop, 4 {
      Loop, 25 {
        Send D{space}
      }
      Send {space}{enter}
     }
     Send {space}{enter}
     return
