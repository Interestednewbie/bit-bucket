SendDragonKeys and dictation to non-full-text windows make mistakes

    Dragon NaturallySpeaking's standard method of sending synthetic
keystroke events to applications (e.g., SendDragonKeys and dictation to
non-full-text-control applications but not SendSystemKeys) does not
always work 100% correctly in Vista and later Windows operating
systems.  In particular, the first event in a sequence of synthetic
keystrokes may be dropped or doubled. 

    For example, sending "hello" may result in "ello" or "hhello" being
typed and sending "Hello" (really {shift down}{h down}{h up}{shift
up}...) may result in "hello" (first press of shift dropped).  Likewise,
sending {ctrl+x}{ctrl+c} via SendDragonKeys may result in x followed by
control-c (the first control press being lost).

This bug is been reported for DNS 10.1, 11.5, and 12 under Vista and
Windows 7.  It is extremely annoying for people using custom commands or
non-full-text-control applications.

In spite of trying over a year, I don't have a recipe that reliably
reproduces this problem on command.  Please feel free to contact me
(mdl@alum.mit.edu) if I can be of any help with tracking down and
eliminating this bug.

I have confirmed that this bug is still present with DPI 14 on Windows 7
