    In DNS 8.1 and earlier, you could use "letter alpha", "letter
Bravo", and the like to spell words or to denote single characters in the
middle of an utterance.  This is no longer working as of DNS 9.5.

    Note that the vocabulary for words like Mike with spoken form m is
not an acceptable replacement as I need both Mike the name and letter
Mike (aka, m) to be recognized correctly on the first try.  The
spell command it is also not an acceptable replacement as it cannot be
used in the middle of an utterance.

Workaround: in DNS 10.1, manually add 26 words of the form "a\letter
Alpha".  This should not work, but does.  In particular, "letter alpha
letter bravo" produces "ab" (which it does in DNS 8.1) in spite of the
fact that the formatting properties specify "a b" (it's two normal
words).
