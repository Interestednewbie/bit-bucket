commands containing numbers ending with -one are no longer recognized

With DNS 12.5, the following commands were recognized fine:

   encode twenty-one 
   encode twenty one 
   just decode twenty one 
   really decode 21 

However with DPI 14, the first of these is no longer recognized.    In
general, any command involving <number>-one  seems to no longer be
recognized.  E.g.,

   encode seventy-one 
   encode forty-one 

are all also not recognized.  Numbers ending in other digits (e.g., -two
or -four) are recognized fine.

This also applies to numbers in lists; e.g., encode <number> where
<number> includes "twenty-one".
