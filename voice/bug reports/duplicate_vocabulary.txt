importing certain dictation-like words yields duplicate word entries

First, note that the word "(" with spoken form "left parenthesis" already exists as a standard built-in word. Now, try importing the following word list via vocabulary->import list of words or phrases...:

<code>
@Version=Plato-UTF8
(\\left parenthesis
</code>

You'll note that Dragon erroneously claims that this is a new word and adds it! If you open the vocabulary editor, you will see two copies of this word, one of which is marked as a custom word.

You can verify these are separate words by independently setting their properties to different values.

I have seen this effect with many of the punctuation symbols with spoken forms. I have not seen it with more normal words.

I'm not able to add duplicate words in this way using the Vocabulary Editor itself. 

[this bug has been present since at least version 11.]

====================

The same problem happens using the import XML feature; example import
file below:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?>

<!DOCTYPE WordExport SYSTEM "http://dragoncontent.nuance.com/dtds/Words10.dtd">

<WordExport NatspeakVersion="14.00.000.180" NatspeakEdition="ProfessionalIndividual" User="new" Topic="General - Medium" Language="ENX" MRECVersion="1.28.100.16375">

	<Word name="(\\left parenthesis">
	</Word>

</WordExport>
