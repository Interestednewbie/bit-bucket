import list of words fails for words with written and spoken forms that are the same except for case

If you try to use the word list importer (vocabulary->import list of words or phrases…) on a word with the same written and spoken forms (examples below) then Dragon silently drops the spoken part. For example, given input file:

<code>
qz\QZ
</code>

It incorrectly creates the word "qz" with no spoken part. Using the new word format does not fix this:
<code>
@Version=Plato
zq\\ZQ
</code>

I'm guessing that Dragon has code to drop the spoken part when it is the same as the written but the programmers accidentally made this a case-insensitive compare by mistake.

I do not know if this bug also exists in DNS 10.1. 


Note that the Vocabulary Editor add function adds these words correctly with no problem.

Note that also words like POE\Poe have the spoken part dropped.

If you try to use the word list importer (vocabulary->import list of words or phrases…) on a word with the same written and spoken forms (examples below) then Dragon silently drops the spoken part. For example, given input file:

@Version=Plato-UTF8
zq\\ZQ

It incorrectly creates the word "zq" with no spoken part (equivalently, it has a spoken part of "zq" rather than the correct "ZQ").

If you use the import XML feature (sample below), it *does* work:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?>

<!DOCTYPE WordExport SYSTEM "http://dragoncontent.nuance.com/dtds/Words10.dtd">

<WordExport NatspeakVersion="14.00.000.180" NatspeakEdition="ProfessionalIndividual" User="new" Topic="General - Medium" Language="ENX" MRECVersion="1.28.100.16375">

	<Word name="qz\\QZ">
	</Word>

</WordExport>
