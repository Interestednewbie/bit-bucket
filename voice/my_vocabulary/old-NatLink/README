    This is my code for loading words and properties (as well as
deletion) using the NatLink API.

* as of DNS 10, dumping and loading of word properties stopped working
* as of DNS 11, written\spoken changed to written\\ spoken
* as of DNS 11, adding and deleting of "special" words stopped working

"Special" words include things like letter Alpha and (:open paren.

(More precisely, "special" words end up added twice -- two copies in the
vocabulary.)

load_words.py has a few debugging changes -- I was trying to get things
to work when I took this snapshot.
