    I've been playing around with Vocola 3 (the normal version on the
website) using a slightly modified version of my new Python compiler as
a preprocessor to turn my Vocola 2 macros into Vocola 3 macros. It
removes contexts, in lines includes, quotes all action words (especially
<'s), remove spaces between function name and ('s, and for now comments
out all commands using extensions other than String and Variable.

I've run into some problems:

  * The default keystrokes sending mechanism sends the wrong keys for
    many special keys.  For example, for example, {up} sends <kp-up>
    rather than <up>.  (Use emac's view lossage - ^h l to see the
    difference.)  While this works for up, it fails for many other keys.
    I believe the kp- prefix means that the numpad version rather than
    the regular version of the key is being sent.

  * AppBringUp is mistakenly claiming it cannot take two arguments (it
    may have one through four arguments)

  * If I delete my command files via file Explorer, Vocola 3 goes into
    an infinite loop (Max CPU) and continues to allocate memory -- I've
    killed it at 800 MB.

  * Likewise, if I copy new versions of my files to an empty command
    directory from remote Samba (slow), I get repeated error messages
    that it cannot open the same file because a process has it open.

  * At least one case, it held a command file open when it shouldn't
    have. Perhaps you're missing a close somewhere?

  * I'm getting the error message " Exception creating SAPI grammar: The
    caller has specified an unsupported format." a lot and some of my
    command files' appear to be being ignored. The error message doesn't
    give a file name so I don't know which grammar(s) are causing the
    problem.
I have tracked it down to the use of "/" as a spoken form; all of these
lines by themseleves produce "Exception creating SAPI grammar: The
caller has specified an unsupported format.":

  * I'm getting a huge number of spurious noise words, but maybe that is
    due to DNS and WSR fighting over the microphone level.
yup, was microphone level

  * Unsurprisingly, a number of Legacy routines aren't supported: Beep,
    ShiftKey, MsgBoxConfirm, TTSPlayString, SendDragonKeys

  * EvalTemplate isn't implemented yet.

  * Variable is slightly different than mine; no Reset and Get doesn't
    appear to take a default argument

*  ButtonClick clicks the wrong mouse button if the primary and
   secondary mouse buttons have been switched by the user.  E.g., it
   clicks the right mouse button instead of the left mouse button.

*  recognition of (go|line|row) 0..99 is poor at times.   Do I also have
   to use spelled-out numbers for WSR?   I thought that was only an
   issue with DNS.
Yes, spelling out numbers improves recognition with WSR as well.
Part of this appears to have been my using -s in number spoken forms

*  there is not any way to turn on command sequences for only some grammars.

[2/3/2013] Emacs *command* issues:

  * keep accidentally trying to use command sequences
  * "erase" is poorly recognized and doesn't work any ways due to kp-bug
  * "Top of file" doesn't work with local emacs due to kp-due
  * "go #"  doesn't work because of built-in WSR command

Firefox: pick puts 'next' link in reedit in different tab -- kp-
related?
