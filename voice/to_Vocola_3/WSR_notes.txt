* ctrl+windows key = toggle sleep/listening


Issues:

* #s better recognized if spelled-out also

* go # is a built-in that is not replaceable

! no word formatting properties

* writes out numbers like 40,000,000

* Spoken forms like "twenty-two" and "LowerWord" are not recognized

* punctuation characters have different names making things like <prn>
  potentially need changes

* "dictation shortcuts": ability to add vocabulary with different spoken
  and written forms
  * recognition was pretty pour, however


Accuracy [DNS not running, microphone volume readjusted]:

    rainbow passage (330 words): 20 error bursts: 94% accuracy
      [DNS was 7 errors, or 97.9% accuracy]

    "erase" is poorly recognized even after trained

    Vocabulary seems smaller

    get lots of noise words if DNS running at the same time because of
      microphone volume conflict


Correction:

  * WSR-friendly windows (subset of DNS full-text-control windows):
    not too bad;  if dictate replacement text, need to do # OK afterwards

  * everything else:
    WSR completely clueless of recent dictation/text
    Vocola 2 remembers last several phrases (emptying when a command occurs)
      * "fix that" brings up correction panel for entire last phrase
      * get only one try: once correct first time, "fix that" no longer available
      * no way to correct a sub phrase
        * appears can use "fix it" on whole phrase then use WSR
          correction on phrase in fix it window
        * this doesn't always seem to work
      * no ability to use "select X" and the like on the recent phrases
        * can write commands to alter text "X" where X is a recent series of
          dictate words but not correct them
      * Vocola does not see mouse clicks or typed keys so "fix that" and
        spacing gets mixed up when you intermix typing and dictating




Notes:

  * <anything> gives unformatted text
