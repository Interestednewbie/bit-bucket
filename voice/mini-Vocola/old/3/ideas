Create and goto Word bookmarks. Very useful for moving around text!

set bookmark 1..9 = SendSystemKeys("{Alt+i}")  Wait(100) k Wait(100) "natlink_$1"  {Alt+a} ;
 go to bookmark 1..9 = SendSystemKeys("{Alt+i}")  Wait(100) k Wait(100) "natlink_$1"  {Alt+g}{esc} ;


restart numbering = {Alt+o}n{Alt+n}{Alt+r}{enter} ;
 continue numbering = {Alt+o}n{Alt+n}{Alt+c}{enter} ;

#the following command capitalises the first word of the current sentence.
 Capitalise first word = HeardWord("go","to" ,"beginning","of","sentence")
                        HeardWord("select","word")
                        HeardWord("\Cap","that")
